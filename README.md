# JSON-Formatter
Can format JSON/Line files into text files and or excel spreadsheets.

Currently this formatter is limited to data formatted like this:

{"name": ["Forensic Safety Group"], "phone": ["(215) 659-2400"], "address": ["543 Davisville Rd", "Willow Grove", ", ", "PA", " ", "19090"]}

However, I might change/update it to be able to format other formatted JSONL files.
